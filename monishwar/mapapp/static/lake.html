        <p align="center" fontcolor="blue">A lake is a large, inland body of relatively still water, surrounded by land, that differs from a river in its lack of continuous flow. Formed through geological processes like tectonic movement, volcanic activity, and glacial erosion, lakes can contain freshwater or saltwater, and they serve as important freshwater resources, habitats, and recreational areas. Lakes vary in size and depth, with major examples including the world's largest freshwater lake, Lake Baikal, and the world's largest lake by area, the Caspian Sea.  
Definition
A lake is defined as a sizable, mostly still body of water contained within a land-based basin. 
It is distinct from an ocean and a river because it is surrounded by land and does not have a continuous, flowing current. 
Types of Lakes
Lakes can be classified by their water type and how they form: 
Freshwater Lakes: Most lakes contain freshwater, with inlets and outlets that flush the water and maintain its quality. 
Saltwater Lakes: Lakes without a significant outlet accumulate salt and other minerals through evaporation, resulting in saltwater conditions. 
Natural Lakes:
Glacial Lakes: Formed when glaciers scrape the ground, creating basins that fill with meltwater. 
Tectonic Lakes: Created when tectonic plates move, causing cracks and depressions in the Earth's crust that fill with water. 
Volcanic Lakes: Occupy the craters of extinct volcanoes. 
Artificial Lakes: Created by humans, often by building dams to store water for irrigation or hydroelectric power. </p>
